        <p><strong>Why STEM by Step?</strong> STEM by Step was created to simplify the research journey for students taking on their first project. It fills the gap left by jargon-heavy guides and outdated methods.</p>
        <p><strong>Who it's for:</strong> High school and early college students with a passion for research but no idea where to start.</p>
        <p><strong>What makes it different:</strong> Clear, concise, modern, and friendly. No fluff, just what you need—step by step.</p>
        <p><strong>Vision:</strong> Empower youth with tools to not only learn science but contribute to it meaningfully.</p>
